    The car's livery was first presented at an event in the Museo Soumaya
    in Mexico City on 21 January 2015, albeit using a modified chassis 
    from a previous car instead of the VJM08 itself.[1][2] The team did
    not participate at all in Jerez and elected to use their 2014 car at
    the first test in Barcelona.[1][3][4] The VJM08 finally made its on-
    track debut at the second and final testing session in Barcelona. This
    delay was in part due to Force India switching to Toyota's Cologne-based
    wind tunnel in Germany. The new tunnel allows the team to test 60% 
    scale models as opposed to the 50% scale they had been using with their
    old tunnel.[5]

    The team used a new car development model for the 2015 season. They 
    aimed to increase the car's performance as the season went on through 
    the introduction of a B-spec car and several other upgrades later in the 
    season.
