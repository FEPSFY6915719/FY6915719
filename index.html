    Brawn GP took the motorsport world by storm the moment it 
    arrived at first test for the 2009 Formula One World 
    Championship.  A small loophole in the rules provided an
    opportunity with huge potential, and while other teams
    inevitebly lobbied to have the device banned, the sport's
    governing body, the FIA, were utterly powerless, for what
    Ross Brawn's technical team had managed was entirely within
    the rules.

<h3 class="h3_ex1" id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    On 5th December 2008, Honda CEO Takeo Fakui announced the withdrawal of Honda from Formula One.  Battered by the financial crisis and an already struggling auto car market, the company could no longer afford the estimated $300 million budget for the season (New York Times, 2008).  After a frantic scrabble by team principal Ross Brawn, he eventually bought the team from Honda for a peppercorn deal of £1 (BBC Sport, 2009).

<h4 class="h4_ex1" id="The aerodynamics involved">The aerodynamics involved</h4>
  <p class="ex1">
    Aerodynamics is the art of manipulating air in such a way that it provides an advantage to the user.  Nature discovered this far before humanity – the first pterosaur existing around 250 million years ago (Britannica, 2025) – but since the Wright brothers’ invention of the first flying machine in 1903 (National Air and Space Museum, 2022) aerodynamic development has skyrocketed.
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
Any gas has a certain pressure – including in the earth’s atmosphere.  Imagine air in a balloon: air particles have kinetic energy, exerting a forces on the walls of the container by colliding with it and thus the air as a whole is pressurised.  On a race car, this effect is the same, except that rather than hitting the walls of a balloon, air particles hit the surface of the car.(Chain Bear, 2018).  Following this, Bernoulli’s principle states that air pressure is inversely proportional to its velocity.  Put briefly - the faster air moves, the lower its pressure.  (NASA, 2021). 
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
One other principal that will be useful later is the venturi effect.  If air is travelling through a tube, it travels at a constant volumetric flow rate.  Because of this, constricting the pipe at a point will increase the velocity at which the air moves (air must move faster in a smaller area to maintain flow rate) (Comsol, 2015).
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
In an airplane, the huge wings on either side are shaped in such a way that air flowing over it is pushed downwards, as well as generating a lower air pressure above the wing than below.  This generates a net upwards force (lift) on the wing, as the air above the wing exerts a smaller force than the air below.  This, in turn, causes the whole aircraft to lift (NASA, 2021).
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
In a race car, aerodynamics is a pursuit of downforce.  A spoiler acts as an aircraft wing in reverse – pushing the car into the ground (Katz, 1996 [ENTER PAGE NUMBERS]).
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
The two main ways in which Formula One teams deliver downforce are through the front and rear wings [attach photo], which both produce downforce as explained in the previous paragraph.  The other principal downforce-generator for an F1 car is called the diffuser.
As well as travelling over a moving car, there will be a significant amount of air flowing underneath the floor.  Refer to the previously detailed venturi effect: it’s thus clear that increasing the velocity at which air travels beneath the car can lead to significant downforce benefit.  This is known within motorsport as the ground effect (Racecar Engineering, 2015). 
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
A diffuser acts similarly to placing a finger over the end of a hosepipe.  It provides a “flared opening at the rear of the floor”, accelerating airflow through the floor, and the taller the diffuser ie. the “flared opening”, the greater the ground effect.  In order to limit the downforce produced by this device, the FIA imposes limits on the length and height of the diffuser.
