    Brawn GP took the motorsport world by storm the moment it 
    arrived at first test for the 2009 Formula One World 
    Championship.  A small loophole in the rules provided an
    opportunity with huge potential, and while other teams
    inevitebly lobbied to have the device banned, the sport's
    governing body, the FIA, were utterly powerless, for what
    Ross Brawn's technical team had managed was entirely within
    the rules.

<h3 class="h3_ex1" id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
   On 5th December 2008, Honda CEO Takeo Fakui announced the withdrawal of Honda from Formula One.  Battered by the financial crisis and an already struggling auto car market, the company could no longer afford the estimated $300 million budget for the season (Sky Sports, 2008)[1].  After a frantic scrabble by team principal Ross Brawn, he eventually bought the team from Honda for a peppercorn deal of £1 (BBC Sport, 2009)[2].

<h3 class="h3_ex1" id="Analysis and discussion">Key background knowledge</h3>
<h4 class="h4_ex1" id="The aerodynamics involved">The aerodynamics involved</h4>
  <p class="ex1">
   Aerodynamics is the art of manipulating air in such a way that it provides an advantage to the user.  Nature discovered this far before humanity – the first pterosaur existing around 250 million years ago (Britannica, 2025)[3] – but since the Wright brothers’ invention of the first flying machine in 1903 (National Air and Space Museum, 2022)[4] aerodynamic development has skyrocketed.
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
  Any gas has a certain pressure – including in the earth’s atmosphere.  Imagine air in a balloon: air particles have kinetic energy, and collide with the wall of the balloon, exerting a force on it, generating air pressure.  On a race car, this effect is the same, except that rather than hitting the walls of a balloon, pressurised air particles hit the surface of the car, creating pressure (Chain Bear, 2018)[5].
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
    Following this, according to Bernoulli’s principle, air velocity is inversely proportional to its pressure.  Put briefly - the faster air moves, the lower its pressure.  (NASA, 2021)[6]. 
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
    One other principal that will be useful later is the venturi effect.  If air is travelling through a tube, it travels at a constant volumetric flow rate.  Because of this, constricting the pipe at a point will increase the velocity at which the air moves (air must move faster in a smaller area to maintain flow rate) (Comsol, 2015)[7].
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
    In an airplane, the huge wings on either side are shaped in such a way that a lower pressure is generated below the wing than above.  This generates a net upwards force (lift) on the wing, as the air above the wing exerts a smaller force than the air below, causing the aircraft to lift (NASA, 2021)[8].
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
    In a race car, aerodynamics is a pursuit of downforce.  A spoiler acts as an aircraft wing in reverse – pushing the car into the ground (Katz, 1996 [ENTER PAGE NUMBERS])[9].  Formula One teams cars downforce through three main devices: the front and rear wing, and the diffuser.
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
    As well as travelling over a moving car, there will be a significant amount of air flowing underneath the floor.  Refer to the previously detailed venturi effect: it’s thus clear that increasing the velocity at which air travels beneath the car can lead to significant downforce benefit.  This is known within motorsport as the ground effect (Racecar Engineering, 2015)[11]. 
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
    A diffuser acts similarly to placing a finger over the end of a hosepipe.  It provides a “flared opening at the rear of the floor”, (Autosport, 2009)[12] accelerating airflow through the floor, and the taller the diffuser ie. the “flared opening”, the greater the ground effect.  To limit the downforce produced by this device, the FIA imposes limits on the dimensions of the diffuser.

  <h4 class="h4_ex1" id="The Double Diffuser">The Double Diffuser</h4>
  <p class="ex1">
    In the 2009 season, the FIA mandated that a diffuser could be no greater than 175mm in height.  Engineers at Brawn GP found a loophole which essentially allowed them to build a second diffuser on top of the normal one, effectively creating a much larger diffuser – providing significant downforce benefits (Autosport, 2020)[13].
  </p>
  <p class="ex1">
    Teams across the grid disputed the legality of this design, however the FIA (the sport’s governing body) shut these complaints down, as Brawn hadn’t broken any rules (Parc Ferme, 2009)[14].  
  </p>

<h4 class="h4_ex1" id="The 2009 season">The 2009 Season</h4>
  <p class="ex1">
    Jenson Button won a record-equalling 6 of the first 7 races of the season (The Guardian, 2009).  This domination provided him with a lead of 26 points over his teammate Rubens Barrichello, and 31 from Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel (Racefans.net, 2009)[15].  For context, a race win was worth just 10 points.

  <p class="ex1">
    Nobody expected, then, that Button wouldn’t win another race in 2009.  F1 is a development race, and after gaining such a huge advantage in the first half of the season, Brawn ran out of money, and couldn’t perform any more upgrades.  Meanwhile, Red Bull Racing was a team on a huge budget, with full intentions of winning a championship as soon as possible (as illustrated by their eight world championship doubles at the hands of Sebastian Vettel between 2010 and 2013).  They brought a double diffuser to the Monaco Grand Prix, as well as a new front wing and engine cover at Great Britain. the latter of which they won (autoevolution, 2009)[16].
  </p>

  <p class="ex1">
    Red Bull’s resurgence continued, picking up wins in Germany (courtesy of Vettel’s Australian teammate Mark Webber), and Japan.  Going into the penultimate round of the season in Brazil, Vettel trailed Button by just 16 points, having halved the gap of 32 that existed after the Turkish round.  This gap meant that Vettel needed to win the race, with Button finishing off the podium, in order to stay in the running for the WDC.  On the Constructors’ side, meanwhile, Red Bull were still in mathematical contention of winning, however their chances were incredibly slim (statsf1.com, 2009)[17].
  </p>

  <p class="ex1">
    For the race, a storm-interrupted qualifying resulted in very poor results from Button and Vettel, qualifying 14th and 16th respectively (Formula One, 2009)[18].  During the race, a valiant effort from Vettel put him in 4th place by the chequered flag, however Button finished close behind in 5th, enough to secure the Drivers’ World Championship, as well as the WCC for Brawn (Formula One, 2009)[19].
